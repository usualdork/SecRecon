- Credit card numbers and personal information

### 2. DAST Scanner
Dynamic Application Security Testing for web applications:
- SSL/TLS configuration analysis
- Security header checks
- Sensitive file exposure detection
- HTTP method testing
- Component vulnerability analysis

### 3. OWASP Scanner
Comprehensive scanning for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
- Intelligent problem domain handling
- Batch processing for efficient scanning
- Advanced timeout controls
- Detailed vulnerability reports

### 4. Leaked API Scanner
Advanced URL credential scanner focused on API security:
- Detects exposed API credentials
- Validates authentication tokens
- Identifies cryptographic keys
- Comprehensive pattern matching

### 5. HTTP vs HTTPS Analyzer
Analyzes HTTP and HTTPS implementation differences:
- Protocol accessibility analysis
- Endpoint response characteristics
- Redirect validation
- Certificate verification

### 6. Subdomain Analyzer
Validates and enumerates subdomains:
- Parallel connection establishment
- Operational status analysis
- Response validation
- Detailed reporting

### 7. Port Scanner
Nmap-based scanner with web technology detection:
- Service discovery
- Open port identification
- Web technology fingerprinting
- Comprehensive scan reports

## üìã Requirements
